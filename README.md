# 🌌 Early Universe Sound Simulator

This Python script simulates the sound of the early universe by generating harmonic waveforms inspired by cosmic microwave background (CMB) theory. It produces a simple pressure wave signal and plays it as audio to mimic what the universe might have "sounded" like just after the Big Bang — scaled into human hearing range.

---

## 🎧 Features
- Generates a composite harmonic waveform representing early-universe acoustic oscillations
- Visualizes the waveform using `matplotlib`
- Plays the sound using `sounddevice`

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib sounddevice
``` 

--- 

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python universe_sound_simulation.py
```
You'll see a waveform plot and hear the simulated sound.

## 📖 Inspiration
Inspired by NASA's sonification of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the acoustic waves that rippled through the hot plasma of the early universe. This simulation is a simplified, creative representation of those primordial sound waves.
